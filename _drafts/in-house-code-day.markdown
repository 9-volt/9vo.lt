10th of May will be an interesting day. That day most European countries will participate in **[Eurovision](eurovision)** - european song contest. It has 2 interesting aspects:

* It has a long history of more than 60 years
* It has a simple rating system

Mainly after the presentation of all songs comes voting perioud. Each country votes for other countries. Countries award 12 points to their favourite song, then 10 to the second favourite, and then scores from 8 down to 1 to another eight songs.

What we can do is we can predict these scores based on different rules. So here is the catch: we gather, try to gess winners, make bets. In the evening we watch this _awesome_ event, compare the results and nominate our internal winners. Let the coding begin.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
